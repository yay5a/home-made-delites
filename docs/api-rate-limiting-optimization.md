# API Rate Limiting Optimization

This document explains the optimizations made to the API rate limiting system in Home Made Delites.

## Problem

The previous implementation had several inefficiencies:

1. **Multiple Aggregation Pipelines**: Each request triggered multiple heavy MongoDB aggregation operations
2. **Costly Querying Pattern**: Using date-based queries and arrays for storing hits
3. **Complex Data Retrieval**: Requiring aggregations even for basic usage stats
4. **Redundant Date Calculations**: Recalculating time periods on every request

## Solution

The rate limiting system was optimized by:

1. **Single-Document Counter Pattern**: Replaced array-based tracking with simple counters
2. **Automatic Reset Logic**: Added time-based reset mechanism instead of querying by date ranges
3. **Reduced DB Operations**: Consolidated multiple operations into a single document update
4. **Indexed Key Fields**: Added proper indexing to the tracking ID field
5. **Optimized Data Structure**: Used dedicated fields for each metric rather than arrays requiring aggregation

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Reduced database load by eliminating aggregation pipelines
2. **Scalability**: More efficient handling of high-traffic scenarios
3. **Accuracy**: Improved rate limiting precision with direct counter tracking
4. **Maintainability**: Simplified code with clearer tracking logic

## Technical Details

### Before

-   Used multiple collections with date-based documents
-   Required aggregation to count hits across time periods
-   Stored individual hit data in arrays
-   Required complex queries for basic statistics

### After

-   Single document with counter fields
-   Automatic time-based reset logic
-   Simple increment operations for tracking
-   Direct field access for statistics
-   Proper indexing for faster lookups

This optimization significantly reduces the database load, especially during high-traffic periods.
